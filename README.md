# Project Details

1. In this project, a web app interfaces with an NLP system. A URL of a news article is passed and the NLP system provides a feedback on the content such as whether it is subjective, objective and also tells the tone - positive, negative or neutral.

2. Webpack is set up - entry point is defined, loaders and plugins are installed, config files are created/modified and development and production modes are setup.

3. There are some interactions that validate the URL passed.
